                <li><b>HTML:</b>is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. </li>
                <li><b>XML</b>is also used to create web pages and web applications. It is dynamic because it is used to transport the data not for displaying the data. The design goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.</li>
